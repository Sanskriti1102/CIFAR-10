# CIFAR-10

## Project Description:
#### Problem statement: 
Create a Deep learning model to predict the different CIFAR10 images.
The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There 
are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data. We have preserved the train/test 
split from the original dataset. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. 
The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. 
"Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither 
includes pickup trucks.

## Details of datasets:
Image size: ( 32 ,32 , 3 ) <br>
Color space: Colored <br>
Number of classes: 10 <br>
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:<br>
airplane  <br>
automobile <br>
bird <br>
cat <br>
deer <br>
dog <br>
frog <br>
horse <br>
ship <br>
